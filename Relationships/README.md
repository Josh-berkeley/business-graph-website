# Relationships - Private Markets Intelligence

A comprehensive relationship intelligence platform showcasing graph-powered network analysis, connection discovery, and predictive risk assessment.

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: Demonstrate graph methodology for relationship reasoning at scale with multi-dimensional network analysis

**Design**: Theia-inspired aesthetics focused on network visualizations and relationship intelligence

## Features

- **Hero Section**: "Relationship Intelligence" with geometric patterns
- **Graph Methodology**: 3-card explanation of Neo4j engine, multi-hop reasoning, and predictive patterns
- **Investor Network Mapping**: Co-investment network visualization with fictional funds
- **Connection Discovery**: Multi-hop relationship path finding with confidence scoring
- **Risk Prediction**: Relationship-based risk analysis (contagion, conflict, concentration)
- **Interactive SVG Networks**: Animated connection visualizations

## The Methodology (Secret Sauce)

1. **Neo4j Graph Engine** - Entity relationships as queryable knowledge graph
2. **Multi-Hop Reasoning** - 2nd, 3rd, 4th degree relationship discovery
3. **Predictive Pattern Recognition** - Risk identification before manifestation

## Use Cases Demonstrated

### 1. Map Investor Networks
- **Co-Investment Network**: Meridian Growth as central hub with 4 co-investors
- **Network Density Analysis**: 12 co-investment relationships, 89% follow-on rate
- **Syndicate Patterns**: Summit Ventures + Peak Capital frequent co-investment
- **Concentration Risk**: 68% risk score due to high interconnectedness

### 2. Find Connections Between Nodes
- **Warm Introduction Path**: Alex Smith → Mike Johnson → Sarah Rodriguez
- **Connection Strength**: 91.2% confidence based on board/professional relationships
- **Multi-Hop Discovery**: Visual pathway through 4 intermediary nodes
- **Alternative Paths**: Secondary routes via Stanford Alumni network

### 3. Predict Risk Through Relationships
- **Contagion Risk**: 78% risk via Summit Ventures SEC investigation affecting 6 companies
- **Conflict Risk**: 54% risk via Mike Johnson's competing board positions
- **Concentration Risk**: 31% risk via Meridian Growth's 67% network connectivity
